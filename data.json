		["Power consumption is not an important design criterion for embedded systems as they are small.",

		["Stack can be used to pass parameters to a function",
		 "Stack can be used to store local variables within a function",
		  "Stack is used to save the callee-saved registers.",
		   "Stack is used for all of the above"],

		   ["Machines with 64-bit addresses are faster",
		 "64-bit machines transfer more data in a single cycle, therefore, the overhead is lower.",
		  "Machines with 32-bit addresses have smaller memory space, therefore, they lose higher fraction of their memory to I/O.",
		   "Memory mapped I/O is a bigger problem in machines with 64-bit addresses than in 32-bit address machines."]
